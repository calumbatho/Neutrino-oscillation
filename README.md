# Neutrino-oscillation
Visualising neutrino oscillation
Transitions  between  neutrino  flavours,  otherwise  known  as  neutrino  oscillation, occur when neutrinos propagate through space.  This is a purely quantum mechanical effect. Typically,  the oscillation effect is illustrated on a static plot,  showing how the probability of observing  a  particular  neutrino  flavour  changes  with  the  distance  travelled.   The  aim  of  theproject  is  instead  use  complex  phasor  diagrams  to  show  how  the  neutrino  flavour  changing amplitudes drive neutrino oscillations in the simple case of a vacuum.  To represent this will require an animation, which will be a completely new way of visualising the effect.  The set of animations created, programmed using python, will ultimately be used as a teaching aid to help visualise neutrino oscillations
